# VTNet Within Tasks

Each directory contains three VTNet implementations, each designed for a different long-term cognitive ability. The directories included are:

- **`VTNet_1000_att`**  
  Contains VTNet models designed for tasks requiring prolonged attention over 1000 sequences.

- **`VTNet_14seconds_att`**  
  Contains VTNet models configured with a 14-second cutoff, optimized for capturing short-term attention.

- **`VTNet_29seconds_att`**  
  Contains VTNet models configured with a 29-second cutoff, suitable for intermediate long-term cognitive evaluations.

Each directory has separate VTNet implementations dedicated to modeling specific long-term cognitive abilities.
