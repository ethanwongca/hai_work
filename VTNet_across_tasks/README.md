# VTNet Across Tasks

This section contains VTNet implementations for modeling cognitive abilities across multiple tasks performed by users. The directories included are:

- **`VTNet_att_1_full`**  
  Contains VTNet models trained on all tasks performed by a user.

- **`VTNet_att_2_full`**  
  Contains VTNet models trained on a subset of tasks (e.g., 14 tasks) performed by a user.

Each directory includes independent VTNet implementations dedicated to modeling specific long-term cognitive abilities across tasks.

To understand VTNet further, please refer to **_A Neural Architecture for Detecting User Confusion in Eye-tracking Data_** and **_Classification of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease with Deep Learning on Eye-tracking Data_**.
